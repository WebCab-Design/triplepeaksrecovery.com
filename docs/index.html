					<p>The first 30-45 days Triple Peaks Recovery begins with an extended, intensive clinical schedule. Everyday, Monday through Friday, each client will participate in morning and afternoon group therapy sessions along with their weekly individual sessions. Depending on mental-health and trauma based issues, clients may receive more than one individual per week including weekly psych evaluations. Each client will also participate in at least two daily fellowship meetings within the community. We offer full gym memberships to our clients and at least once per week a morning group session is replaced with recreational based therapy at the gym. The goal within the first 30-45 days is for the client to focus on themselves before stepping down in the level of care. A strong clinical start helps the staff better understand the goals of each client and make appropriate recommendations for their continued care. Within the PHP portion of the program clients also participate in equine therapy and auricular acupuncture therapy.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>The remaining portion of the Triple Peaks program emphasizes life skills and the implementation of those skills. Each client will continue to participate in the clinical setting with their morning group therapy sessions, Monday through Friday, including their weekly individual sessions. Equine therapy, recreational therapy, vocational/ art therapy are also continued.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>After their morning groups we require that every client participate in resume building, filling out applications, and going out on job search. Every client will hold a job during their time within our program. When they receive their first paycheck they will start to budget their own weekly allowance for food and toiletries. We also require that each client take on their own cell phone payment. All other money earned from their job is saved and given to them in full upon completion of the program. When properly budgeted, individuals can save anywhere from <!-- { "layout": "*" } -->,000 to  ,000 within the time period of our program giving them a great start in the next part of their recovery journey. We provide transportation for everything.</p>
					<p>The end treatment goal for all our clients is for them to be accountable, independent adults who are able to work and maintain a job, pay bills, and live a life of recovery. Working alone can present major challenges for an individual in recovery e.g. working around inviduals who are themselves using drugs and alcohol. Rather than having to deal with these types of triggering events on their own, everyday they are able to return to both a sober based community and clinical setting to talk about and work through these real life challenges. Every client in the IOP setting has the opportunity to work Monday-Friday from 11AM-5PM and anytime on Saturday.</p>
